# Ancient Vision - AI-Powered Image Conversion Project

## Overview
**Ancient Vision** is developed for **PR201**, a group project limited to contributors. It aims to create a web-based platform that allows users to transform modern images into styles that mimic ancient artworks using advanced algorithms and AI-based techniques.

## Objective
Ancient Visionâ€™s goal is to apply styles from historical art movements (such as Renaissance, Baroque, Impressionist, and Ancient Egyptian) to user-uploaded images through deep learning models. The project replicates the intricate features of these art styles, providing an efficient and real-time image conversion experience.

## Features

- **Image Upload:** Users can upload images in formats such as JPEG and PNG.
- **Style Selection:** Users can choose from ancient art styles, including Renaissance, Baroque, Impressionist, and Egyptian.
- **AI-Based Style Transfer:** The platform utilizes **Neural Style Transfer (NST)** and **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to apply the chosen art style to the uploaded image.
- **Customization Controls:** Users can adjust the intensity of the applied style with sliders controlling brushstroke thickness, texture, and colour filters.
- **Preview Function:** A real-time preview is provided before the final conversion.
- **High-Resolution Outputs:** The converted images retain high resolution and quality.

## Technical Details

### Key Algorithms and AI Techniques

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Used for feature extraction from both the uploaded images and ancient artworks.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Generate images that mimic the texture and colour balance of classical art styles.
- **Neural Style Transfer (NST):** Blends the content of the input image with the selected ancient art style.

### Workflow

1. **Image Upload:** Users upload an image to the platform.
2. **Style Selection:** Users choose the art style they want to apply.
3. **AI Style Transfer:** Deep learning models apply the chosen style.
4. **Customization:** Users can adjust the intensity and other visual elements of the style.
5. **Preview and Download:** The platform provides a preview before downloading the final high-resolution image.
